# Scalable Machine Learning - Titanic Dataset
For this lab, we trained a machine learning model to predict survival and deployed it as a Serverless ML System using Hopsworks, Modal and HuggingFace.

The steps were the following:
1. A Feature Engineering pipeline was created to use only the useful features in our model and save the data into a Feature Group in Hopsworks.
